PHYTON START

In order to understand the syntax of this language better I decided to try out some simple stuff. Due to the high demand and popularity of this language, the files include more than just exercises or syntax try-outs, they should also include explanations at times. The w3school tutorial is simple enough most of the time so explanation are only present where w3 fails to fully mention everything.

LINK TO THE W3 TUTORIAL: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp

This repo is dedicated for anyone (very dear to me) that wants to learn Python. I hope these documents can serve as a helping hand!

Below you can find descriptions of each document currently present in the repo. I will update the README as I go.

*** Try-it.py :

  - First doc created mainly for my own understanding. Most stuff is explained or self-explanatory but it's pretty lenghty. In the future I might come back and section it instead of keeping everything in one place. Because most of the stuff in it is easy there are no major concearns when compilling despite the fact that there are a million prints.
  - You can keep this doc on the side while you try to understand the w3 tutorial and check it whenever you fail to understand something. Notice how I try to write things myself at times even if it seems redundant. Understanding is not the only goal, in order to become familiar with the syntax of a language I find it most helpful to build habits and muscle memory by typing. Therefore, take the w3 code and don't hesitate to tweak it, play with it and well... make it your own (sort of!).


That's all for now,
